# multiply

This is a minimal example of a NodeJS Ingescape agent using the Node JS binding.
You need to edit the call to igs.startWithDevice in multiply.js to adapt it to your environment by giving a proper network device name and change the port if needed. This example lists the available network devices by calling igs.netDevicesList.

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
