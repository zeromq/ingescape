# Contributing to Ingescape

The contributors are listed in AUTHORS (add yourself when you submit a PR). This project uses the MPL v2 license, see LICENSE.

Please read these documents BEFORE you send a patch:

* Ingescape uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions. Please read this if you are unfamiliar with it.

* Ingescape tends to use the [CLASS (C Language Style for Scalabilty)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21) guide for code style. Please read this, and also read the existing code base.

* Ingescape adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for versioning and keep a Changelog based on format [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Please read this if you are unfamiliar with it.

Ingescape follows the ZeroMQ community practices. As such, it grows by the slow and careful accretion of simple, minimal solutions to real problems faced by many people. Some people seem to not understand this. So in case of doubt:

* Each patch defines one clear and agreed problem, and one clear, minimal, plausible solution. If you come with a large, complex problem and a large, complex solution, you will provoke a negative reaction from Ingescape maintainers and users.

* We will usually merge patches aggressively, without a blocking review. If you send us bad patches, without taking the care to read and understand our rules, that reflects on you. Do NOT expect us to do your homework for you.

* As rapidly we will merge poor quality patches, we will remove them again. If you insist on arguing about this and trying to justify your changes, we will simply ignore you and your patches. If you still insist, we will ban you.

* Ingescape is not a sandbox where "anything goes until the next stable release". If you want to experiment, please work in your own projects.

If you upgrade Ingescape binding version, please keep in mind that MAJOR and MINOR bindings versions **MUST** follow the MAJOR and MINOR Ingescape version.
